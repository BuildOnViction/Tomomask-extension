Dear TomoMask Users,

TomoMask is beta software. 

When you log in to TomoMask, your current account's address is visible to every new site you visit. This can be used to look up your account balances of Ether and other tokens.

For your privacy, for now, please sign out of TomoMask when you're done using a site.

There have been several instances of high-profile legitimate websites such as BTC Manager and Games Workshop that have had their websites temporarily compromised. This involves showing a fake TomoMask window on the page asking for user's seed phrases. TomoMask will never open itself in this way.
